# Predicting Patient Length of Stay
# Overview

This project is a data application designed to predict hospital length of stay for patients using machine learning models (Linear Regression & Random Forest). The app is built with R Shiny and provides functionalities for data uploading, cleaning, visualization, analysis, and prediction.

By leveraging historical hospital data, the app helps healthcare professionals estimate patient admission durations, enabling better resource allocation and patient care planning.

To ensure proper deploy and utilization of the app the necessary features the user must have are Rstudio to access the code and open the application, and the Patient Length of Stay dataset. Both can be downloaded here:

After downloading has been completed the user can open the code and run it through Rstudio, this will prompt the Shiny App to load. To log in to the system to use the credentials are:

Username: admin
Password: adminpass1

From there the user can upload the dataset from Kaggle. To get help on how the product should be used the user can access the "help" function located below.
